The Android Exploid Crew
========================

(b)rings you root for the masses:


Android 1.x/2.x softbreaks
--------------------------

As always:

<ATTENTION>

This code is under the GPL.
It comes with absolutely NO WARRANTY, and you cant blame
me for any damage it may cause.

This program may make your device completely unusable and broken.
You may loose all your data and warranty of the device!

The program is intended for educational and demonstration
purposes only.

</ATTENTION>

Since jailbreaking is no longer illegal (DMCA), we now
also provide ARM5 ELF binaries for your convenience.
The source of rageagainstthecage will be provided soon, as feedback
arrives. It is exploiting a missing retval setuid() check inside adb.

This tarball also includes the original and modded versions of exploid.c
as well as rageagainstthecage.c which is
particular for the Droid2 and Backflip devices or devices
where exploid-hole has been patched OTA.

If you like what we are doing you can send us PayPal money to
7-4-3-C@web.de so we can compensate time, effort and HW costs.
But you are not forced to do so.

You can use the provided gif/jpg as a background
image of your phone in order to feel cool in front of the gatekeeper
before he kicks you because you look too geeky for
the disco-girlz! Mind the crap!

Exploid2 creates /system/bin/rootshell which is only accessable via adb,
so no evil appz can execute commands as root. If that fails,
it makes /system/bin/sh +s root though.

The binaries have to be uploaded to the device via "adb push"
inside a writable and executable directory such as

/sqlite_stmt_journals
/data/local/tmp
/tmp

After executing, they are self-explaining. After seeing '#' you
are root. The jailbreaking has actually been done then,
no matter what other tutorials tell you! You might want
to install your Superuser.apk then in order to enable
tethering etc. You can use one of the many instructions found
on the web to do so.

For those not familar: we know; exploit is written with 't'!
RageAgainstTheCage is named after a similar named band which
makes good music.
